# Productive Mining Platform

## Overview

This is a revolutionary blockchain platform that replaces traditional wasteful proof-of-work mining (like Bitcoin's SHA-256) with productive mathematical computation. Instead of wasting computational power on arbitrary hash calculations, miners solve real mathematical problems like the Riemann Hypothesis, prime number patterns, and quantum field theory validations while maintaining blockchain security.

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection for live mining data
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for broadcasting mining updates
- **Data Storage**: In-memory storage with interface for database integration
