# Productive Mining Platform - GitHub Pages Deployment

This is a static build of the Productive Mining Platform, configured for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Directory Requirement

**The error "File '/workspaces/ProductiveMining/App.tsx' is not a module" occurs when build commands are run from the wrong directory.**

**Solution**: Always run build commands from the `github-pages-build` directory:

```bash
# CORRECT
cd github-pages-build
npm run build

# INCORRECT (causes the error)
npm run build  # from main project directory
```

Use the verification script to check your setup:
```bash
cd github-pages-build
./verify-setup.sh
```
